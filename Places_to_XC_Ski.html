  <h2>Best Places to Cross Country Ski in Canada</h2>

  <h3>CANMORE</h3>
  <p>Canmore is located in the mountains about an hour outside of Calgary, and is home to the training grounds of Canada’s national biathlon and ski teams. The facility was built for the 1988 Olympics and has hosted many world cup events since then. It is an excellent facility with hundreds of kilometers of very wide trails. Some popular trails even have multiple classic tracks to allow people to socialize on the trail, as well as controls traffic, allowing everyone to go their own speed. There is also a wide variety of terrain types, from gradual hills to long, steep inclines so that everyone at every skiing level can be challenged.</p>

  <h3>WHISTLER</h3>
  <p>The small tourist village of Whistler is buried deep in the heart of the British Columbia’s Rocky Mountains. This location packs a wonderful view of the surrounding mountains and beautiful village. There are over 160 kilometers of groomed trails, 32 kilometers of which are located just outside of the village, while the rest is located in the Callaghan Valley who hosted the venue for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. This is an amazing facility that offers ski lessons, rentals, snowshoe and dog friendly trails so that everyone can participate and have fun.</p>

  <h3>PRINCE ALBERT NATIONAL PARK</h3>
  <p>Prince Albert National Park is a beautiful landscape of rolling hills, crystal clear lakes, and magnificent scenery. There are approximately 56 kilometers of trails located right beside Waskesiu Lake in the townsite, although there are about 100 more kilometers of trail connected to, or just outside of the park. It is a relatively uncrowded place in winter, allowing someone to find peace and quiet while escaping many of our chaotic lives. The facility also has 6 warm-up shacks on some of the longer trails so that you can extend your skiing excursion to another day, or just to pop-in so you can warm your fingers. All around, it is a wonderful place to spend a weekend skiing.</p>
