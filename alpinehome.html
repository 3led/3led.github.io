  Alpine Skiers will usually ski at a resort that has chairlifts to get them to the top of a mountain very fast, and to use their

  <li> <strong> Green circle:</strong> For beginner skiers and is easy to ski on, they are wide, groomed, and shallow, slope of 6% to 25%. </li>
  <li> <strong> Blue square: </strong> For intermediate skiers, requires slightly more skill to navigate in compared to Green circle trails. They make up most of the trails in ski resorts. They’re also usually the ones filled with the most people, they have a slope of 25-40%. </li>
  <li> <strong> Black diamond: </strong> For advanced skiers. They are very challenging and usually their trails start closer to the top of the mountain. They can be ungroomed with slopes of 40%+. </li>
  <li> <strong> Double black diamond: </strong> For experts only. These runs are extremely steep and ungroomed. Usually they are very narrow, these trails are usually empty or close to empty. </li>
