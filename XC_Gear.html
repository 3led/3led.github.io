  <h2>What Gear is Needed to Cross Country Ski?</h2>
  <p>Generally speaking, cross country skiing requires skis, special ski boots, and poles. Cross country skis are long and narrow, unlike short and wide alpine skis, although there a Backcountry skis (also known as Touring Skis) which are long , wide, and developed to keep skiers floating on the snow where there are no tracks set. You must also have special boots because they allow you to "bind" your foot to the ski by attaching the boot to a specialized binding. However, you must be careful because there are many different binding systems, and most boots are not compatible with another binding system other than the one it was designed for. The most common binding systems are New Nordic Norm (NNN) and Pilot Salomon Nordic System (SNS Pilot). Make sure you never mix these up!</p>

  <h3>Gear Fitting</h3>
  <p>Most cross country skis are now built based on a weight range so that they can improve your performance (below is a sizing chart). Sometimes the height and skill level will also be taken into consideration when selecting a ski. More experienced skiers may choose a longer ski because it offers more glide and they are confident with their maneuverability on the skis, while it is optimal for beginners skiers to start with a shorter ski. Poles are fitted to a person based on their height. As a general rule of thumb, classic poles should be approximately 80% to 85% of your body height which is usually between the armpit and the top of the shoulders. Skating poles should be roughly between your chin and your nose, although it may be easier for beginners to start by using a slightly shorter pole. When purchasing skis and poles, remember that they are measured in centimeters, while boots are measured much like shoes but often use European shoe sizing to increase accuracy and consistency. Check out the tables below.</p>
    <p>All skis need to be regularily tuned up and properly cared for, which you can choose to do independantly at home or by paying a professional at your local ski shop. For almost all skis, this includes waxing them properly with glide wax and grip wax (only use grip wax on classic skis that don't have skins or "fish scales"). In the occurence that you don't know how to wax your skis, you can ask your local ski dealer for a demonstration, or click on the links below to see a demonstration.</p>
