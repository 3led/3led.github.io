  <h1>SKIING</h1>
  <h2>What is Alpine Skiing?</h2>
  <p> Alpine Skiing refers to the type of skiing where skiers get transported to the top of a mountain and ski down it. 
  Alpine Skiers will usually ski at a resort that has chairlifts to get them to the top of a mountain very fast, and to use their 
  groomed trails and artificial snow. “Off-Piste” skiing is another form of alpine skiing that skiers refer to when they use snowmobiles, 
  helicopters, or even snowcats to travel to skiing terrain that doesn’t have groomed trails. 
  This type of Alpine skiing is mainly used for experienced skiers as the snow condition of ungroomed snow can change very 
  quickly in a short amount of time. The way that ski trails are classified as are in these categories: </p>
  <ul>
  <li> <strong> Green circle:</strong> For beginner skiers and is easy to ski on, they are wide, groomed, and shallow, slope of 6% to 25%. </li>
  <li> <strong> Blue square: </strong> For intermediate skiers, requires slightly more skill to navigate in compared to Green circle trails. They make up most of the trails in ski resorts. They’re also usually the ones filled with the most people, they have a slope of 25-40%. </li>
  <li> <strong> Black diamond: </strong> For advanced skiers. They are very challenging and usually their trails start closer to the top of the mountain. They can be ungroomed with slopes of 40%+. </li>
  <li> <strong> Double black diamond: </strong> For experts only. These runs are extremely steep and ungroomed. Usually they are very narrow, these trails are usually empty or close to empty. </li>
  <h2>Why Ski?</h2>
  <p>Like cross country skiing, alpine skiing has a range of physical benefits such as: burning calories, improving balance and eye-foot coordination, strengthening  abdominal and leg muscles, increasing flexibility, and strengthening bones and joints. A healthy body makes a healthy mind! Skiing is also a good opportunity to bond with family and friends. </p>
