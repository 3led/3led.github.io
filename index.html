  <h2>What is Cross Country Skiing?</h2>
  <p>Cross country skiing is an excellent activity to keep your body healthy and fit through the winter. It involves attaching long, narrow skis to special boots, then gliding through the snow with the assistance of lightweight poles. It is a relatively easy and simple sport which anyone, at any age can participate in as long as you have an abundance of snow. Cross country skiing also offers all levels of competition, from recreational to the Olympic level, depending on how serious you intend to be. There is even special equipment for enthusiasts who want to ski during summer!</p>
  <p>Within cross country skiing there are two main techniques. First, there is Classic Technique, which is very simple and easy to learn for those who are new to skiing. It is the most popular type of recreational skiing because it requires very little skill, gear can be relatively inexpensive, and you can go wherever you want with them (groomed trails are not required). Classic skis often require a special wax that provides grip to the midsection of the ski, but some models are “waxless” and use scales or fur attached to the ski instead. The second way to cross country ski is Skating Technique (also known as Free Technique). This is a much more advanced way to ski, but is very similar to ice skating. Skating Technique uses slightly shorter skis that don’t use grip, more advanced boots with ankle support, much longer poles, and requires a groomed track approximately 2 meters wide. This is the perfect way to cross country ski if you are experienced or a person who enjoys a challenge and likes going fast.</p>
