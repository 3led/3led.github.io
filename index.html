  <h2>About Skiing</h2>
  <p>Cross country skiing is an excellent activity to keep your body healthy and fit through the winter. It involves attaching long, narrow skis to special boots, then gliding through the snow with the assistance of lightweight poles. It is a relatively easy and simple sport which anyone, at any age can participate in as long as you have an abundance of snow. Cross country skiing also offers all levels of competition, from recreational to the Olympic level, depending on how serious you intend to be. There is even special equipment for enthusiasts who want to ski during summer!</p>
