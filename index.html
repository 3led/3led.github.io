    <h2>What is Cross Country Skiing?</h2>

    <div id="whatiscc">
  <p>Cross-country skiing is an excellent activity to keep your body healthy and fit through the winter. It involves attaching long, narrow skis to special boots, then gliding through the snow with the assistance of lightweight poles. It is a relatively easy and simple sport which anyone, at any age can participate in as long as you have an abundance of snow. Cross country skiing also offers all levels of competition, from recreational to the Olympic level, depending on how serious you intend to be. There is even special equipment for enthusiasts who want to ski during summer!</p>

  <p>Within cross country skiing there are two main techniques. First, there is Classic Technique which is very simple and easy to learn for those who are new to skiing. It is the most popular type of recreational skiing because it requires very little skill, gear can be relatively inexpensive, and you can go wherever you want with them (groomed trails are not required). Classic skis often require a special wax that provides grip to the midsection of the ski, but some models are “waxless” and use scales or fur attached to the ski instead. The second way to cross country ski is Skating Technique (also known as Free Technique). This is a much more advanced way to ski, but is very similar to ice skating. Skating Technique uses slightly shorter skis that don’t use grip, more advanced boots with ankle support, much longer poles, and requires a groomed track approximately 2 meters wide. This is the perfect way to cross country ski if you are experienced or a person who enjoys a challenge and likes going fast.</p>

  <h2>Why Should You Ski?</h2>
    
  <p>Cross Country Skiing is a great way to keep your body healthy through the winter months when most people are relatively inactive. It covers all aspects of wellness, from physical to psychological. There are many benefits to taking up skiing. One of the greatest parts of this sport is that you can participate for your whole life, unlike other sports where there is only a certain period in your life which you can play. Cross country skiing offers people a way to maintain fitness through their entire lives. Cross country skiing also has a strong community across Canada. Joining your local ski club can help you make new friends or find a positive role that gives back to the club that provides trails for the public to use. Ski clubs also host fun events for everyone such as ski lessons, races, loppets, and ski swaps.</p>
