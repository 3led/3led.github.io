        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br>- The word 'ski' comes from
            the Norwegian term 'skíð', meaning a split piece of wood.<br><br>
           - Modern competitive alpine skiing is split up into 4 categories: 
            Slalom, giant slalom, supergiant slalom, and downhill.<br><br>
            - Skiing is available in about 80 countries!<br><br>
            - Norway's army in the 1700s formed ski battalions. Many
            believe that this is how ski races originated.

  <h2>How to Stay Safe While Skiing (Alpine)</h2>
  <p>Although skiing is incredibly fun, there are some risks with it.
      Follow the steps below to insure that you have the most enjoyable
      and safe time while skiing!
  </p>
  <ul id="alpinecat">
    <li> <strong>Proper equipment: </strong>Make sure you're wearing helmets and goggles,
        and potentially wrist guards. Make sure that the equipment you use are
        designed for skiing/snowboarding (don't use bike helmets!). Next, make sure 
        that they're certified by CE, Snell, or ASTM. Lastly, follow fitting instructions!
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Stay warm: </strong>Most of the time it isn't enough to just put on a jacket
         while skiing. You should do your best to dress in layers (thin base
         layer to wick moisture away from skin, midlayer like a jacket/pullover
         for insulation, outer layer to waterproof/snowproof yourself). You also
        need to protect your extremeties (fingers & toes & ears) during cold weather as they
        are the most prone to frost bites. Have 
        thick skiing socks, insulated gloves/mittens, and a face mask/scarf/toque for your ears. 
        During extremely cold conditions, you can even store

            Hand warmers are small (mostly disposable) packets which are held in the hand and produce heat on demand to warm cold hands. They are commonly used in outdoor activities. Other types of warmers are available to provide soothing heat for muscular or joint aches.

Depending on the type and the source of heat, hand warmers can last up to 10–13 hours. (from wikipedia)

    </li>
    <li> <strong>Ski with others: </strong> Traveling alone in a new environment 
        can be suspect, especially for younger children/teens, but many 
        adults feel this way too! It is nice to have the assurance that if
        you get stuck or lost somewhere someone will be out there looking
        for you! The social aspect of skiing also makes it more enjoyable!
        You can look for new people to ski with at the local Regina skiing club!
       (More info below safety tips)
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hazards: </strong>While skiing, make sure you
        are aware of your surroundings! Watch out for other skiers, poles, trees,
        sudden changes in slope, and <strong>icy patches!</strong> Icy patches are 
        formed when snow melts and freezes. They make slippery conditions for your 
        ski. You can prevent ice related incidents by controlling your acceleration, 
        not making sudden movements (your skis can't cut into ice), lowering your center 
        of mass, and widening your skiing stance. 
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Weather: </strong>Checking the weather reports & forecasts 
        surrounding your mountain before you ski is essential! Skiing 
        while it is snowing can be a pleasant experience aesthetically 
        and texturally, but beware of blizzards. Your visibility will tank 
        and the wind speeds will make you freeze. To mitigate the effects 
        of undesirable weather, make sure you have a pair of snow goggles (
        protects your eyes from snow and wind, & going snow blind).
        Also watch out for weather that is too warm (above 5 C). These 
        conditions make snow slushy, sticky, making it harder to make turns.
         </li>

  <h2>Regina Ski Club</h2>
  <p>
    The Regina Ski Club is a way for people from Regina to develop a ski 
    community. It creates opportunities for recreational and competitive 
    cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, and snowboarding! <br><strong>Member prices are:</strong>
    <br>Single: $40 for season
    <br>Two: $70 for season
    <br>Three: $80 for season
    <br>Four+: 90$ for season
    <br>~<br>

    All Regina Ski Club members automatically become members of the Saskatchewan 
    Ski Association (SASKI) and Canadian Ski Association (CSA). There are programs 
    for ages 3-93, available at all ability levels, and even including biathlon 
    programs. The Regina Ski Club organizes several Alpine and Nordic trips 
    each year, as well as

      <div class="modal-body">
        Most people consider Nordic and cross-country skiing to be the 
        same sport, but they are actually different! Nordic skiing is 
        any style of skiing that is done on ungroomed terrain, off the trails, and 
        on mountains that are less steep while cross-country skiing is done 
        on groomed terrains. Nordic skiing started thousands of years ago as 
        a mode of transportation for the Scandinavians. Today, Nordic skiing has a 
        free-heel binding system and skis that are much lighter and narrower.
